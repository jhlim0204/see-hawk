# SeeHawk
This is a project for Nanyang Tehcnological University SC2006 Software Engineering.

SeeHawk is a website that enables users to search any existing hawker centres in Singapore. The goal of Seehawk is to provide a one-stop-shop for users who are looking for information on hawker centres. By providing ratings, reviews, and live information on nearby car parks, Seehawk aims to make it easier for users to find great food in a convenient location.

## How to Run
To begin, ensure that you have **npm** installed on your computer.

Navigate to the folder where the code is located (i.e. the **see-hawk** folder) in the command line prompt and enter the command **npm install** to install the necessary dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, run the command **npm run** and wait for the website to launch. You can now access the website at **localhost:3000**. Please note that the initialization process may take some time to complete if you are running the application for the first time.

## Note
This repository only contains the project's source code and JSDoc. Please be aware that it does not encompass other SDLC-related documentation, which includes but not limited to Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Software Requirements Specification and Demo Video.
